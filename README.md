# This one is with react and tailwind

## In this template tailwind is already configured with react JSX syntax. This is the   project we use for creating multipages but simpler applications. with our own design.

For installing this use command in your git bash terminal
 $ git clone <github_https_link>

Then use command in command prompt or powershell for installing all the requireed templates.
 > cd folder_name
 > npm install

You can go on now.

If you want to install more libraries for UI, I will suggest

 -> react-icons
